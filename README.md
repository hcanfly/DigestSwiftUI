# DigestSwiftUI

DigestSwiftUI is an iOS 15 SwiftUI app that requires Xcode 13. It uses the new TimelineView to continuously display a view of images. It also uses the GeometryReader to layout several other views. I haven't installed the iOS 15 beta on my phone so this has only been tested in simulators.
